            <p class="lead mb-5">
                Most of the movies released in US belong to either fiction, action, thriller genre in nature and focuses
                more on the cinematics and action sequence.
                On rare occasions movies with <em> social message and with good human characteristics </em> subjects are
                also released but despite the good nature of the content
                such movies doesn't fare well in the box office and go unnoticed. In my Blog, I have provided few really
                good movies which
                insists on Hard Work, Dedication, Focus to achieve ones goals despite hardships.

                                        <strong>The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind </strong>is a 2019 British drama film written, directed by
                                        and starring Chiwetel Ejiofor in his feature directorial debut.
                                        The film is based on the memoir of the same name by William Kamkwamba and Bryan
                                        Mealer.
                                        Born in Kasungu, Malawi, William Kamkwamba is a young schoolboy who comes from a
                                        family of farmers who live in the nearby village of Wimbe.
                                        William has a talent for fixing radios for his friends and neighbours.
                                        By the mid-2000s, the family's crops fail due to drought and the resulting
                                        famine devastates William's village.
                                        Seeking to save his village from the drought, William devises a plan to build a
                                        windmill to power the town's broken water pump.
                                        The Boy who harnessed the wind movie portrays a boy's hardwork and dedication in
                                        bringing water to his village using wind energy.

                                        <strong>The Pursuit of Happyness </strong>is a 2006 American biographical drama film directed by
                                        Gabriele Muccino and starring Will Smith as Chris Gardner,
                                        a homeless salesman. Smith's son Jaden Smith co-stars, making his film debut as
                                        Gardner's son, Christopher Jr. The screenplay by
                                        Steven Conrad is based on the best-selling 2006 memoir of the same name written
                                        by Gardner with Quincy Troupe. It is based on
                                        Gardner's nearly one-year struggle being homeless. The unusual spelling of the
                                        film's title comes from a mural that Gardner
                                        sees on the wall outside the daycare facility his son attended. The film portays the struggle, 
                                        unfazed hardwork and dedication by a father on how he came up in life from a homeless state.

                                        <strong>The Imitation Game </strong>is a 2015 American historical drama film
                                        directed by Morten Tyldum and written by
                                        Graham Moore, based on the 1983 biography Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew
                                        Hodges.
                                        The film's title quotes the name of the game cryptanalyst Alan Turing proposed
                                        for answering the
                                        question "Can machines think?", in his 1950 seminal paper "Computing Machinery
                                        and Intelligence".
                                        The film stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing, who decrypted German intelligence
                                        messages for the
                                        British government during World War II. Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Rory
                                        Kinnear, Charles Dance,
                                        and Mark Strong appear in supporting roles. This film shows how much passion, 
                                        hardwork and dedication a person puts in to solve a complex encoding machine.
